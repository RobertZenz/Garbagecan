Movement Test 2
-

Basically just my first try to simulate a 2D-overhead world. Main though was to keep the hero in the center of the screen and let the hero move into the edges if the map is at it's end.

Not working 100% correctly, there seem to be some calculcation and logical errors in here. Will not fix.
